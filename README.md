# Conference Event Planner (React)

This is a React web application I built as part of my IBM Full-Stack Developer certification course on Coursera. The project focuses on learning React components, Redux state management, and modern web development practices.

## What does it do?

- **Event Management**: Create, view, and manage conference events with detailed information.
- **Attendee Tracking**: Handle attendee registration and management for events.
- **Interactive UI**: Modern React components with responsive design and user-friendly interface.
- **State Management**: Uses Redux for managing application state and data flow.
- **Component Architecture**: Demonstrates proper React component structure and reusability.

I built this project to get comfortable with React and Redux while following the IBM Full-Stack Developer course curriculum. It helped me understand:
- How to structure React applications with components
- Redux for state management and data flow
- Modern web development practices
- Building interactive user interfaces

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces
- **Redux**: State management library for predictable state updates
